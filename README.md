# top-library

I'll have the form, which creates the object. The object will be put into an array that has a key. 
for instance: 
{key1: {object1}, key2, {object2}}

the object will have the following properties: 

    book1:{
        name: "Harry Potter",
        author: "JK Rowling",
        read: "true",
        isbn: "kcnkdlimce",
        dateCreated: datetime string
    }, 

ok so I have my book constructor, and a way to save user data, get user data. What is next? 

Create a new card with that data

delete card function
