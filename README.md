# top-library

I'll have the form, which creates the object. The object will be put into an array that has a key. 
for instance: 
{key1: {object1}, key2, {object2}}

the object will have the following properties: 

    book1:{
        name: "Harry Potter",
        author: "JK Rowling",
        read: "true",
        isbn: "kcnkdlimce",
        dateCreated: datetime string
    }, 

alright, now the basic memory stuff is set up for the default library. Now for adding 
to the library. 

maybe easiest thing to do is just update the library,
increment the booknum
save the user info
reload the page.
